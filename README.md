UiFriendlyzr
============

Allows to record a step by step scenario explaining goal of different parts of a web page

Demo here: http://emyann.github.io/UiFriendlyzr/

I need to do some work on the demo but if you want to test it, follow theses instructions:
- Click on REC
- Select a block
- Type a tooltip in textarea and save it for this block
- Select another block, do the same as previous and so on
- At the end click again on REC button
- Now let's click on play and hover block to display tooltip
- Refresh the page, press play and tooltip are always here !!

Blocks' reference are saved using a generated fingerprint , so you can move blocks to another location without tooltips disappear.

Stay tuned, I'll will bring lot of features.

Fork it if you're interested
